"The sun was shining on the sea,  
Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
The billows smooth and bright—  
And this was odd, because it was  
The middle of the night.

Spinning through space for eons,  
our earth—oceans, rivers, mountains,  
glaciers, tigers, parrots, redwoods—  
evolving wonders.  

And our vast array, generations. of humans—  
all shapes, colors, languages.  

Can I be the only me?  
Our earth: so much beauty, hate,  
goodness, greed.  
“Study. Cool the climate,” advises my teacher.  
“Grow peace.”  

Can I be the only me,  
become all my unique complexity?
